This is just a baseline rule-based model.

Later, we can refine it with machine learning, combining historical weather +
skincare outcomes (dryness, irritation, acne reports) to train a recommendation model.

need to create a data base with Foreo product list:
in order to do this, i need to understand what kind of information i can obtain
about these products, things i would like:
1. ingredients in products
2. use cases of products
3. relationships between ingredients and weather
4. relationships between type of products and weather


Need more knowledge about the buissness logics that are needed
